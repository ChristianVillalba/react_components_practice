## Description
This project is a Greeting application ,      
The greeting message and its colour, will change depending on the hour:

(in red colour, between 0:00 and 11:59)

## What I have learned with this project:
* Use of components
* Import / Export functionality
* Separate the logic on individual components
* Render depending on conditions (in this case, depending on the current time)
* Using date , the JavaScript Object to retrieve the current time.
